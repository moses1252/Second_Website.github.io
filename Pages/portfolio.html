            <p class="sum">As a Computer Science major I have had a dynamac set of experiences of which I learned from. 
              Each one of those experiences I took something thing from each and everyone of them. 
              This has allowed me me to expaned my horizon in terms of what I capable of.

                    I mantained a G.P.A of 3.0 for the first two years as a full time student, and as a result I have made the deans list. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the duration of the past three years I have learned Python, MySQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React JS, extensively deep 
                    knowledge of java, and Haskell. I also have worked with wordpress for a short period of a time, so I have work with web design in a variety 
                    of ways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have attended a Hackathon, which I believe allowed me to experience so much within a short span of time. I believe
                    this tested my leadership skills, collaboration skills, and the most important skill, which is quickly adapting
                    to any problem that arose.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the summer of 2018 I used PyCharm IDE to program a game using python. At this time I was working a job, so I learned to 
                    manage my work time from my programming time. I see this as an accomplishment because I spent hours into this 
                    project, and this made my passion for programming more apparent to me. The game was a galaga type game, so there
                    were many actions and input in which I had to incorporate into this project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After taking a CS Web development class, shortly after, I ran for web officer for the Association for Computing Machinery(ACM). 
                    I ran for this position and I am now the Web officer for Cal State LA ACM board for fall 2020 to spring 2021. I found my love 
                    for web development during my cs class, so being the web officer was a great start to get to work with a great team and to gain
                    experience I wouldn't have gotten anywhere else.
